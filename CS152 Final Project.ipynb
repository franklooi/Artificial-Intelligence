        "This Python implementation solves the [2048 puzzle](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) using Artificial Intelligence. Essentially, this game is about getting one tile to 2048 by merging identical tiles (eg: 2 + 2 = 4, ..., 1024 + 1024 = 2048) where each move subsequently generates a new random tile. The most common search algorithm used in 2048 solvers are minimax algorithms, where the solver AI and the tile generator each take turn to make moves while the solver AI maximizes its score. \n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of minimax, however, this implementation uses the [expectimax search algorithm](https://web.uvic.ca/~maryam/AISpring94/Slides/06_ExpectimaxSearch.pdf) where the solver performs maximization over all possible moves (up, down, left, and right) based on the expected utility of each move. At each decision node, the algorithm uses depth-first search to branch into subtrees for all possible tile spawns (chance nodes) to calculate the expected utility for a given move. \n",
        "\n",
        "Using expectimax, however, has a downside of not being able to use pruning methods. Therefore, the algorithm needs to utilize depth-limited search and scoring heuristics to optimize the brute force search.\n"

        "## Performance of the Solver\n",
        "\n",
        "### Depth-limited search\n",
        "Generally, the deeper the search, the more informed the search algorithm can be about the subsequent states. However, this accuracy has a significant effect on speed of the algorithm, given that it takes about 1000 moves on average to complete the puzzle. The depth-limit of this algorithm is most effective between 3 - 6. A depth-limit of 4 generates about 75% win rate at an average time of 2m 40s (6 moves per second), while a depth-limit of 3 generates about 50% win rate at an average time of 16s (60 moves per second).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scoring Heuristics\n",
        "Several heuristics are used to direct the optimization algorithm towards favorable positions. The heuristics are combined to compute a positional score which determines how good a given board position is, while the optimization search aims to maximize the average score of all possible board positions. The precise choice of heuristic has a huge effect on AI gameplay and consequently, the performance of the algorithm. \n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Corners**\n",
        "\n",
        "This heuristic grants a high score for having the largest tile on the top left corner. The idea behind this is to preserve the largest value in a corner position by fixing it in a row that is fully occupied at all times, which is a common strategy for human successful gameplay. This also means that the algorithm minimizes down/right movements (the forbidden move) and favor up/left movements during merging. The highest tile value is multiplied with a weight, and this heuristic score becomes larger as the game progresses, so as to (almost) definitively secure the largest value the corner spot, since one displacement can result in a loss (since the algorithm has to rebuild whatever tile is on the top left corner and may run out of smaller tiles to merge).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Empty Tiles**\n",
        "\n",
        "The larger the number of empty tiles in the grid, the more move options the solver has. Move options can quickly run out when the game board gets too cramped, for example left/right movements are impossible when the columns are fully filled and horizontal merging is not possible. This heuristic gives a bonus for having as many empty tiles as possible at any point during solving.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Monotonicity**\n",
        "\n",
        "This heuristic works with the corner heuristic by creating monotonically decreasing tiles in the top row. This facilitates merging to the left and towards the largest tile value. For instance, if the top row is [128, 64, 32, 16], the algorithm can merge left consecutively to build a 256 tile once a merge on the 16 is done. Similar to the corner heuristic, the multiplication of weight by tile value also ensures progressively larger values are stacked in the top row, delaying merging until they could be merged with the corner value altogether. This heuristic also applies monotonicity throughout the board to facilitate merging (working alongside empty tiles), though with smaller weights than the top row.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Smoothness**\n",
        "\n",
        "Using monotonicity heuristic alone tends to create grid positions where adjacent tiles are decreasing in value but in order to merge, adjacent tiles need to be the same value. Therefore, this heuristic attempts to penalize adjacent tiles with a large value difference (e.g. if 1024 is next to 2) because they cannot readily be merged, also working alongside empty tiles to minimize ineffective tiles. Value differences are calculated in logarithmic space, since the numbers are all exponents of 2."

        "\n",
        "As stated above, the speed-accuracy tradeoff of this implementation is large, even between depth limits 3 and 4. A depth limit of 4 is 10 times slower than depth limit of 3, but 1.5x more likely to complete a 2048 tile. Therefore, there is a need for speed-related improvements that can be made to maintain high accuracy and relatively low runtimes.\n",

        "1.   Optimizing data structures - implement a highly-optimized data structure such as using bit values to represent integers and a table to represent the grid and heuristic scores. [This GitHub implementation](https://github.com/nneonneo/2048-ai) uses such a methodology and also use table lookups for heuristic scores and the representation of grids after each move. This improvement would help trim the solver runtime by allowing the AI to search a huge number of game states in a short period of time.\n",
        "2.   Dynamic programming - a large contributor to slow runtimes is the recursion of the expectimax algorithm. One can prevent the algorithm from recursing into states it had previously encountered using a [transposition table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_table), which is essentially memoization applied to the expectimax tree search. The search should terminate and yield the result much faster than having the explore all the nodes. This could be equivalent to pruning the tree and reducing state spaces.\n",

        "Further improving this implementation's accuracy is also possible.\n",
        "1.    Optimally weight heuristic scores - currenly, I have a large weight on the corner heuristic while small weight on the smoothness heuristic which is based on my style of play. To find the optimal distribution of weights for each heuristic, we need to use multivariable optimization perhaps by running the algorithm over and over again while making incremental adjustments (i.e. hill-climbing) or incorporate stochasic processes to reduce likelihood or arriving at local optima rather than the global optima (i.e. simulated annealing). \n",
        "2.    Reinforcement learning - this method would use a non-heuristic approach to learn the game, but use its historic gameplay data to figure out the best moves to make at each state. This approach would improve over time, as the AI plays more and more games. I have no doubt that a sufficiently well-trained AI will beat my implementation in speed and accuracy, since data is stored and processed to refine the AI over time.\n",

        "1.    Improving color schemes of this implementation - since the colors from the colorama are limited, there are some colors used in this implementation that are not as easy to the eye as they could be. An improvement to this is to use [ANSI escape sequences](http://jafrog.com/2013/11/23/colors-in-terminal.html) which can display up to 16 million colors (though it has to be run on a terminal, instead of being within a notebook)\n",
        "2.    Integrate this AI solver with the actual [2048 game interface](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) - it would be cool to be able to watch this AI solve the game on the original platform, though this may require screen capture to \"see\" the tiles and port the output of our algorithm as a keyboard button press. However, this is out of the scope of this project for now."
